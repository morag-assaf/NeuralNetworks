Sakranut_Project
This is the second part of the assignment.
In this section we will train a NN model based on the raw data and the synthesized data.

In this exercise we shall evaluate the performance of the following hyper-parameters:
1. Number of hidden layers
2. Number of neurons in each layer (divided into initial and the rest)
3. Learning Rate

The code is written with 4 sections:
1. Main (main_nn): Designed to load the data from CSV, send to model and print results
2. Data preparation (dataPrep): Designed to do all data processing.
3. Model (classificationModel): Designed to run the NN model
